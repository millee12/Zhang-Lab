1) Remove the mirror feature about y=1
2) Implicit acceleration FSI scheme, in block.f90 include various density for the whole fluid domain and in r_sstiff.f90 remove the acceleration term
3) Since we want the implicit FSI scheme, the FEM interpolation is the only option right now
4) The solid part still include the feature that we can have two different solid descriptions, the in mien_solid.in we have to have an additional line that describe the solid elements belong to cover or base.
5) To use the FEM interpolation, LAPACK is required to solve a linear system in sh_exchange to get the FEM interpolation function. 
Note: LAPACK on CCNI works well but on SOCREC requires more efforts.

Add shx_tets.f90 to calculate 3-D tets case's shapefunction in
data_exchange.f90.

1) In r_sstif.f90 change 'acc=acc-xmg', so that the gravity term is
consistent with the eqaution.

2) The internal force should be in the opposite direction when it is
distributed onto the fluid nodes. Therefore, I just change the sign in
r_sstif.f90 instead of change the sign in the interpolation codes since the
external and acceleration terms should keep their signs. In r_sstif.f90, it is
changed to FSI=-interal+exteranl-acceleration.

In r_spiola_elastic to calculate first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, "J" should be
the determinant of the deformation gradient matrix, but originally we use det
which is the determinant of Jacobi to initial coordinates.
define "detf" and call determinant to solve the determinant of xot which is
the inverse of F.  detf=1/{det(F)}

found bugs in rigid cases:
1. In solid_update.f90, solid density is density_solid+den_liq. Solid density read in from input_fluid.in is the density
difference.
 
2. Added vel_time.m output in solid_update.f90 and hypo_prepare_solid.fi
(define file name). This was in the older version. 

3. In ensight_output.f90, when generating fem.case, format is wrong when
writing the word 'fem.geo******'. Should use 'A13' instead of 'A12'.

4. In parseinput.f90->subroutine 'parseinput_solid', bug found when reading
shift, rewrite do loop, add shift1 in declaration. This is a bug when
converting the input_solid.in to the new format.

1. renamed the folder IFEM2007

2. tested the code for cavity case on SCOREC machines. Succeeded. Results
verified

3. tested the code for cavity case on Mac Powerbook. Failed due to
"segmentation fault" (limit in stack size). But cannot find a way to increase
it on Mac.
------------------------

1. Organized, cleaned, and tested the IFEM code, named it
"IFEM.2007_Fluid_deformable_solid"
-----------------------

1. shape.f    --> call only one time, directly after parseinput

2. solids part can now handle both hyperelastic material and linear elastic material
option 1 --> hyperelastic material
option 2 --> linear elastic material

3. fixed one bug in the /ifem_before_rkem -> doesn't take initial conditions
uncomment ds(1:ndf,1:nn) = eps1 in subroutine formd in form.f90

4. fixed one bug in r_stiff.f90 subroutine
	predrf(nu1)=predrf(nu1)+fu*w
	it was '-' before, but according to the equation, it should be '+'
--------------------------

ifem-v4 fix, 02/03/2005
found bugs in fluid solver
1. the stabilization parameter defined in the momentum term is wrong. One term multiplied by prs_c, and is now multiplied by prs_cc.
	fixed in both block.f and blockgmres.f
2. In form.f90, remove (if idf<ndf) statement when apply boundary conditions. 
3. In blockgmres.f90, the statement res_c=(res_c+(...))/alpha is changed to
     res_c=res_c+(...)/alpha
4. in length.f90, the statement hg=V^(1/3), if(twod)hg=sqrt(V), if (nen=4) hg=(8*V)^(1/3) 
is changed to if (nsd=3) ...and if (nen=4) hg=(8*V)^(1/3) endif, if (nsd=2) hg=sqrt(V).
Now, now the nen=4 is included in the 3D only.
5. quad2d4n.f90
if (igau=1) then gau(1:3,1)=-1 is changed to gau(1:2,1)=0.00
6.  In parseinput.f90
 when call read_int(static_onoff,1)..... elseif (static_off=0) then...
Before it was elseif(hg_vol_onoff=0)
7. Cleaned all the warnings - unused variables.
-----------------------------
Mickael, 02/04/2005
1. Changed the stabilization parameter of the continuity equation. Use the one from Tezduyar
   (2003), tau(SLIC)
-----------------------------
Mickael, 02/09/2005
1. Bug in quad2d3n.f90, the values for the 3 points quadratures were wrong.
-------------------------------
Mickael  02/20/2005
1. Bug in hypo_declaration_solid.fi and ensight_output.f90, The variables solid_stress, 
solid_strain, fluid_stress and fluid_strain are not defined correctly (size in 2D was wrong)
2. In ensight_output.f90, solid_stress and solid_strain was going from 1 to 6  in 2D instead of  1 to 4
-------------------------------
Mickael  03/04/2005
1. Bug in solid_update.f90: solid_vel goes from 1:nsd_solid, not 1 to 3.
-------------------------------
Mickael  03/14/2005
1. Bug in r_stang.f90: solid_stress and strain were not added over the integration points
